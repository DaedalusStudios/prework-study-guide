# Bootcamp Prework project

## Description

This project was created to assist me in learning more about Github CLI as a part of an ASU EDx bootcamp for full stack developers.  I'm starting to get a little more familiar with Github CLI and Github in general by following this pre-work.


## Installation

This is a web project with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  You can deploy it on any basic web-host.  I suggest IIS on Windows, or LAMP on Linux.

## Usage

Eitehr host the site on a web server, or run it locally.  Since there's no server-side processing you won't actually need to fire up an application pool.  Just open index.html!

## Credits

Me!
